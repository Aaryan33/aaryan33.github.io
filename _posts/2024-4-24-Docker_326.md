title: Setting Up the Multi-Container Application with Docker (21BCP326)
---


## Introduction
Docker is an open-source platform that automates the process of deploying applications inside lightweight, portable containers. These containers bundle an application with all of its dependencies, including libraries, frameworks, and other necessary components, into a single package. This encapsulation ensures that the application runs consistently and reliably across different environments, regardless of the underlying infrastructure.

One of the key benefits of Docker is its ability to eliminate the "works on my machine" problem that often plagues software development teams. By packaging applications into containers, developers can guarantee that the software will behave the same way in development, testing, and production environments. This consistency streamlines the development workflow and reduces the likelihood of deployment-related issues.

### Prerequisites
Before we begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:
- Docker installed on your machine so for that download docker desktop
- ![image](https://github.com/Aaryan33/aaryan33.github.io/assets/97274994/b9fb5247-b4af-4291-b4ca-81b59456071b
)

- Basic understanding of Docker concepts 
- Knowledge of your application's frontend and backend technologies through docker documents:

)



## Part 1: Docker Setup
### Step 1: Installing Docker
To install Docker, follow these steps:
1. Visit the Docker website and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3. Once installation is complete, verify that Docker is installed by running `docker --version` in your terminal.

### Step 2: Docker Basics

-> **Image** : In Docker an image serves as an self sufficient software bundle that's capable of running a designated application or service. It encompasses the application code, runtime settings, essential system libraries, dependencies and other required files, for operation

-> **Container**  :  A Docker container is similar, to an portable package that contains all the essentials for an application to function seamlessly. It consists of the application as the necessary tools and configurations. These containers operate autonomously on your device with each containers data being separate, from that of others.

-> **Dockerfile**: A text file that contains all the commands needed to assemble a Docker image.

## Part 2: Creating Docker Images
### Step 3: Frontend Dockerfile
Create a Dockerfile for the frontend application (assuming it's built with React). Here's an example:

)



### Step 4: Backend Dockerfile
Create a similar Dockerfile for the backend application.

)




### step 5: Building the images

You can now build both images using the following commands

Building the Frontend Image:

)


Building the Backend Image:

### step 6: MySQL docker  container

```
docker run -d --name Docker --network Docker_Assignment -p 3307:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=<password> mysql:8.0
```

Creating a database and tables inside the mysql container 

```
 docker exec -it Docker mysql -u root -p
 ```
 Then you will be asked for password which is  `your_password`. 
 After that enter the following SQL queries in order to create a new Database.

)



## Part 3:  Running the application 
### step 7: Building the containers 
To build all three containers use this command:

1. Frontend  React app:
```
docker run -d --name front_img_21bcp326 --network Docker_Assignment -p 3000:3000 front_img_21bcp326
```

2. Backend NodeJS Express server :
```
docker run -d --name back_img_21bcp326  --network Docker_Assignment -p 5000:5000 back_img_21bcp326 
```
3. MySQL Server:
```
docker run -d --name Docker --network Docker_Assignment -p 3307:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=pass1234 mysql:8.0
```

)


### Step 8: Open in Browser
Open http://localhost:3000 to see the Reacjs App and http://localhost:5001/students to see the API response from the express server.

)



To Check if the Application is running or not we can check that the data is comming to mysql or not by running the query in mysql container 

```
Select * from students;
```
